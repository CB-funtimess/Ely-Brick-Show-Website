    <h2>
        Ely Brick Show - A showcase for some fantastic Lego models!
    </h2>

    <p>Ely Brick Show was created by father and child duo Duncan and Kayla, who sought to bring the magic of Lego shows to Ely. 
        This is its third year - the first year was a relatively small show located at the Countess Free Church and the second year was a virtual show aiming to showcase a wide variety of 
        builds. This year, Duncan & Kayla hope to bring the magic back in-person with a much larger show than before!
