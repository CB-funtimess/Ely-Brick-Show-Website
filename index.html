    <h2>
        Ely Brick Show - A showcase for some fantastic Lego models!
    </h2>

    <p>Ely Brick Show is back for its fourth year - last year we raised over £4000 for our charity, Ely Christians Against
    Poverty.<br/>
    This year we have an expanded team, Duncan, David, Laura and Brian and a team of over 30 enthusiasts who will be
    bringing the magic back with a much larger show than ever before!
